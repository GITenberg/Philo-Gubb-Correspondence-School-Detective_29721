description: 'A hilarious parody of the detective genre - Gubb emulates Sherlock Holmes
  and maintains an office for his two occupations: correspondence-school detective
  and wallpaper hanger. One of the first and best detective parodies. "Detecktating
  is my aim and my profession." Thus speaks Philo Gubb in this classic volume of criminally
  silly comic exploits; with irresistible period illustrations by Rea Irvin. Philo
  Gubb: Correspondence-School Detective was picked by none other than Ellery Queen
  (Queen''s Quorum #61) as one of the most important detective books ever written.
  Ellis Parker Butler (1869- 1937) was a native of Muscatine, Iowa. Dropping out of
  high school to help support the family he worked in a number of jobs including ones
  in a spice mill, an oatmeal mill, a china store, and a wholesale grocery. Moving
  to New York City in 1896, he began writing for trade magazines such as the Tailor''s
  Review, the Wall Paper News, and The Decorative Furnisher. In 1905, his humorous
  short story, Pigs is Pigs appeared in the American Magazine, and the following year
  it was published in book form. Its phenomenal success allowed Butler to give up
  editing trade papers and turn to full-time authorship.--publisher.'
